RehiveTech Management System is an ecosystem used for remote monitoring and maintainance of IoT gateways and embedded devices in general. Gateway with the client software installed reports required data to the cloud and allows to monitor not only itself but also the elements of sensor network that are connected to the device. IQRF wireless technology is also supported and offers an advanced management of IQRF nodes. The solution enables operators to address most of the necessary operating interventions remotely using web interface available for any type of device (computer, tablet or smartphone). This works not only for one gateway but the system is primarily designed for management of group of devices (e.g. in case of the need to update multiple devices simultaneously).

### Step 3
Each registered gateway is identified by an unique identifier called **token** that can distinguish one particular device or also the whole group of devices. Copy the installation command to your device client console where you must be logged as a root user or run the command with `sudo`. Do not forget that the device must be connected to the internet.
