Std. DDC-SE

// 1st sensor is on-board TR temperature sensor.
// 2nd sensor is either Dallas 18B20 or MCP9802 temperature sensor at DDC-SE01 board (according to the HW jumper position) chosen at the runtime based on the SW detection.
// 3rd sensor is light intensity indicator at DDC-SE01 board (value range is 0[max light]-127[max dark]).
// 4th sensor is potentiometer value at DDC-SE01 board (value range is 0[left stop]-127[right stop]).

Work in progress!
